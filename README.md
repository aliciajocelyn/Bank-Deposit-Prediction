# Bank-Deposit-Prediction
A bank is facing a revenue decline due to a significant number of clients opting not to invest in long-term deposits. To address this issue, the bank aims to identify customers with a higher likelihood of subscribing to long-term deposits. 

I will apply machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can forecast which customers are most likely to subscribe to these deposits, enabling the bank to make marketing strategies for better customer engagement. The app will be deployed using FastAPI.

This problem is used for my Model Deployment class in 4th semester final exam.
